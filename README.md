Hello kindly reviewer.

Firstly: DON'T PANIC
Secondly: Have you got your towel?


Getting Started:
NOTE: Please ignore the various Playground files
To run the MerchantsGuideToTheGalaxy:
open the file: MerchantsGuideToTheGalaxy.xcodeproj
With the Xcode project open, run the program (command+R)
the Simulator will launch with the application running.

Evaluating Inputs:
Clicking "Run Program" will evaluate the text that is pasted in the top textBox
The output will appear in the bottom right hand textbox marked: "Program Output"

command+A, Command+c and command+v all work with the Simulator
command+(left arrow) can rotate the screen for more screen real estate.

Additional Functionality:
Although it was not requested, I added functionality.
If the text in "Program Output" matches the text in "Test Output", 
"Program Output" will highlight a green colour.
Use this function to easily test additional inputs.
