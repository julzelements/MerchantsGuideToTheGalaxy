# MerchantsGuideToTheGalaxy
Written using:
Apple Swift version 2.1.1 
Apple Xcode Version 7.2.1


Hello kindly reviewer.

Firstly: DON'T PANIC
Secondly: Have you got your towel?


Getting Started:
NOTE: Please ignore the various Playground files
To run the MerchantsGuideToTheGalaxy:
open the file: MerchantsGuideToTheGalaxy.xcodeproj
With the Xcode project open, run the program (command+R)
the Simulator will launch with the application running.

Evaluating Inputs:
Clicking "Run Program" will evaluate the text that is pasted in the top textBox
The output will appear in the bottom right hand textbox marked: "Program Output"

command+A, Command+c and command+v all work with the Simulator
command+(left arrow) can rotate the screen for more screen real estate.

Source Files:
All the classes and view controllers are in "MerchantsGuideToTheGalaxy" folder.

Additional Functionality:
Although it was not requested, I added functionality.
If the text in "Program Output" matches the text in "Test Output", 
"Program Output" will highlight a green colour.
Use this function to easily test additional inputs.



Known Bad Functionality:
The RomanNumeral Reader will only give a correct result for a correct roman numeral.
As thus, an invalid numeral will give an incorrect result that appears valid!
This really needs to be fixed. : (


Final note:
This was a pretty massive undertaking. 
I had a great time on the weekend that I wrote this.
It has quashed all remaining doubt that I had about wanting to be a programmer.
For this, I guess I owe you guys one!
